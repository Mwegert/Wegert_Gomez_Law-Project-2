1) Ensure your .hql file, 'workflow.xml', and 'hive-config.xml' are
in the same directory in your hdfs. hive-config is the site.xml from '/usr/lib/hive/conf'.
2) Ensure the .properties file on your local machine has the correct
application path, pointing to the directory that contains the above files.
3) put Gender_StatsData.txt in your hdfs under /user/cloudera/project2/input
4) put Gender_StatsCountry.txt in your hdfs under /uder/cloudera/project2/input
5) Run 'export OOZIE_URL=http://localhost:11000/oozie'
6) Run 'oozie job -run -config project2.properties'
	-this should output a jobID
7) Run 'oozie job -info [jobID]' to check the status
	**OR just check Hue Scheduler

oozie job -oozie http://localhost:11000/oozie -kill [JobID]
